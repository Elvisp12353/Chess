# Chess
This is my proyect. I'm making a chess game

## How to play

- First you need to start a game pressing option 1
- Then you'll have 3 options: Move, castling and give up
  - **Move:** you'll choose the piece you want to move depending on two coordinates (Y,X) then press enter and in the same way put the coordinates where you want to move the piece. important coordinates must be 2numbers one after the other example: "12" "20" 
  - **Castling:** You'll choose the coordinates of the king and then the rook. **You can only castle once per game** 
  - **Give up:** You will end up the game and give the victory to the other player
